# Neural Network for EMNIST Handwritten Letters üìùü§ñ

Welcome to our Neural Network project for recognizing handwritten letters using the EMNIST dataset! This repository contains all the code and resources you need to get started with training and testing your own neural network model.

## About EMNIST Dataset

EMNIST (Extended MNIST) is a dataset consisting of handwritten letters and digits derived from the original MNIST dataset. It's a perfect benchmark for testing machine learning algorithms on handwritten character recognition tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/poorani-muthu/Machine-Learning-models/Neural Network.git
```

2. Train the neural network model:

```
python train.py
```

3. Test the trained model:

```
python test.py
```
