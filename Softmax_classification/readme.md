# Multiclass Classification with Gradient Descent: Iris Dataset

This repository contains an implementation of a custom multiclass classification model using gradient descent. The project focuses on training and testing a model on the Iris dataset, a widely-used dataset in machine learning, and includes key metrics such as accuracy and loss plots.

---

## Features

- Implements **gradient descent** for optimizing the weight matrix.
- Uses the **softmax function** for multiclass classification.
- Includes a custom `Multiclass` class for model training, loss visualization, and prediction.
- Trains and evaluates the model on the **Iris dataset**, a classic dataset in machine learning.
- Outputs **model accuracy**, **predictions**, and **loss curves**.

---

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
```

## Project Structure

The script contains the following key components:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Loads the Iris dataset and splits it into training and testing sets.

2. **Loss and Gradient Calculation**:
   - Defines functions for calculating loss and gradients required for optimization:
     - `loss()`: Computes the softmax loss for a given dataset and weights.
     - `gradient()`: Calculates the gradient of the loss with respect to weights.

3. **Gradient Descent**:
   - Implements a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the loss over multiple iterations:
     - `gradient_descent()`: Performs iterative updates to the weight matrix and tracks the loss.

4. **Multiclass Model**:
   - Encapsulates the training, loss visualization, and prediction steps:
     - `fit()`: Trains the model using gradient descent.
     - `loss_plot()`: Plots the loss curve for the training process.
     - `predict()`: Predicts class labels for given input data.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Tests the model on unseen data and computes accuracy using:
     - `balanced_accuracy_score()` from `scikit-learn`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-multiclass-classification.git
   cd iris-multiclass-classification
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

3. The output will include:
   - A plot showing the loss curve over training steps.
   - Predictions on training and test datasets.
   - Model accuracy on the test dataset.

## Dataset

The project uses the Iris dataset from `scikit-learn`. It includes 150 samples of three flower species (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`) and their respective feature measurements:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
