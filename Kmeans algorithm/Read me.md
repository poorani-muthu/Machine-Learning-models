**ðŸ“Š K-Means Clustering README ðŸ“Š**

Welcome to our K-Means Clustering project repository! Here, we delve into the fascinating world of unsupervised learning, specifically focusing on clustering individuals based on their annual income and expenditures using the K-Means algorithm.

### Dataset 
Our dataset serves as the backbone of this exploration. It comprises anonymized records of individuals, each characterized by their annual income and corresponding expenditures.

### Clustering
The crux of our endeavor lies in the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm. Through this methodology, we aim to uncover inherent patterns and groupings within our dataset, shedding light on distinct segments of individuals based on their spending behaviors and income levels.

### Centroids
Within this clustering framework, we discerned five centroidsâ€”representative points encapsulating the essence of each cluster. These centroids serve as pivotal landmarks in delineating the varying spending habits and income distributions across our dataset.

### Repository Contents
- `kmeans.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook serves as our playground, housing the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm and the subsequent analysis.
- `data.csv`: A CSV file containing the raw dataset, essential for replicating our experiments and conducting further analyses.
- `results/`: Delve into this directory to explore the fruits of our laborâ€”insights, visualizations, and revelations drawn from the clustering analysis.
